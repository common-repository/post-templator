1. When you activate the plugin, a menu called "Templates" will be added. You can edit an existing "Welcome to Post Templator" article, or you can "Add New" a template.
2. It's very similar to the "Posts" page. The left side is a place to write the template, and the right side is a text box where you can change the wording.
3. Enter the converted wording in the text box. 10 items can be set from [text1] to [text10]. Change the new creation pull-down to "Yes" and save as a draft or publish.
4. A draft post will be created with the template applied to the post page.
5. It will be created with only "[text1]" converted in the title and body. It is convenient when creating many pages with different keywords, such as articles explaining terms and articles explaining people.
